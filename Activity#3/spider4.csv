"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","4","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","6","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","10","15 July 2017"

"randreww","After the more adult cliff hanger of the last film, one would expect Spider-man to follow a more mature & intelligent return than this spin-off slop! 
What is this? Spider-Kid?All the action is virtually impossible to follow as per the trite ""shaky cam"" technique & the score is forgettable. Characters exclaim at one another as the script kills brain cells. But seriously! This toddler looks so silly in the custom I'm surprised his sleeves down drape over his hands!","2","20 September 2018"
"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","10","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","2","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","4","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: De Volta ao Lar"" (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"")","1","21 October 2017"
"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","6","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","7","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","9","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","9","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better!

(Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","10","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","10","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","8","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","10","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics.

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","9","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","9","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","4","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","6","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","10","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","9","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","2","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","4","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","1","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice.

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","7","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","10","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","10","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","10","31 January 2020"

Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite.

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","8","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","10","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","10","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","9","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","9","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","4","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","6","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","10","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","9","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","2","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","4","7 July 2017"

"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","6","10 March 2018"

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","10","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change.

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","9","8 July 2017"
"twpain","Spider-Man Homecoming is a refreshing Mcu film. It's very fun and lighthearted with great characters and entertaining scenes. The action sequences are very good and the movie knows when to be goofy and when not to be.","10","6 June 2020"
"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","7","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better! Let's take a look at what makes this the best Spider- Man. 1. Web Shooters (Check) 2. Sense of humor (Double Check) 3. Spidey Sense? (Check) 4. Great Love interest? (Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","10","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","10","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","10","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","9","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","9","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","4","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","6","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","10","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","9","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","2","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","10","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","1","7 July 2017"

"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films.

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","9","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","10","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","10","8 July 2017"
"twpain","Spider-Man Homecoming is a refreshing Mcu film. It's very fun and lighthearted with great characters and entertaining scenes. The action sequences are very good and the movie knows when to be goofy and when not to be.","7","6 June 2020"
"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","10","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better! Let's take a look at what makes this the best Spider- Man. 1. Web Shooters (Check) 2. Sense of humor (Double Check) 3. Spidey Sense? (Check) 4. Great Love interest? (Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","8","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","10","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","9","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","9","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","9","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","6","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","10","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","9","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","2","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","10","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","2","15 July 2017"

"randreww","After the more adult cliff hanger of the last film, one would expect Spider-man to follow a more mature & intelligent return than this spin-off slop! 
What is this? Spider-Kid?All the action is virtually impossible to follow as per the trite ""shaky cam"" technique & the score is forgettable. Characters exclaim at one another as the script kills brain cells. But seriously! This toddler looks so silly in the custom I'm surprised his sleeves down drape over his hands!","1","20 September 2018"
"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","6","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","7","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","10","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: De Volta ao Lar"" (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"")","9","21 October 2017"
"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","10","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","9","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","7","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","8","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better! Let's take a look at what makes this the best Spider- Man. 1. Web Shooters (Check) 2. Sense of humor (Double Check) 3. Spidey Sense? (Check) 4. Great Love interest? (Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","10","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","9","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","9","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","9","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","4","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","10","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","9","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","2","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","10","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","2","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","4","15 July 2017"

What is this? Spider-Kid?All the action is virtually impossible to follow as per the trite ""shaky cam"" technique & the score is forgettable.

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","7","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","10","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","9","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: De Volta ao Lar"" (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"")","10","21 October 2017"
"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","9","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","10","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","10","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","10","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better!

(Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","10","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","9","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","9","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","4","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","6","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","9","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","2","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","10","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","2","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","4","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","1","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","10","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","9","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","10","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice.

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","10","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","7","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","8","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","10","31 January 2020"

Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite.

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","9","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","4","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","6","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","10","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","2","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","10","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","2","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","4","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","1","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","6","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","9","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship.

Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","10","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","9","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice.

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","7","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change.

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","10","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","9","31 January 2020"

Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite.

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","4","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","6","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","10","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","9","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","10","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","2","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","4","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","1","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","6","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","7","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","10","7 July 2017"

"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films.

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","10","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change.

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","10","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","9","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better!

(Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori.

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","6","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","10","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","9","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","2","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","2","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","4","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","1","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","6","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","7","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","10","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","9","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","10","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","7","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: De Volta ao Lar"" (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"")","10","21 October 2017"
"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","8","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","10","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","9","8 July 2017"
"twpain","Spider-Man Homecoming is a refreshing Mcu film. It's very fun and lighthearted with great characters and entertaining scenes. The action sequences are very good and the movie knows when to be goofy and when not to be.","9","6 June 2020"
"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","9","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better!

(Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","4","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","10","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","9","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","2","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","10","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","4","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","1","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","6","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","7","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","10","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","9","15 July 2017"

"randreww","After the more adult cliff hanger of the last film, one would expect Spider-man to follow a more mature & intelligent return than this spin-off slop! 
What is this? Spider-Kid?All the action is virtually impossible to follow as per the trite ""shaky cam"" technique & the score is forgettable. Characters exclaim at one another as the script kills brain cells. But seriously!

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","10","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","7","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","10","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: De Volta ao Lar"" (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"")","8","21 October 2017"
"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","10","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","10","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","9","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.","4","31 January 2020"
"T-ZER0","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better!

(Triple Check)I am super glad that Sony let the MCU work with them on a Spider-Man film. His costume is colorful and nice, and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man actor so far. Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite. I really want her back for another film.I want to end this review by asking stop sending death threats to Tony Revolori. He was a great Flash Thompson and you all should be ashamed of yourselves.","6","11 October 2017"

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.","9","9 July 2017"
"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.","2","21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...","10","27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!","2","11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image","1","20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2","6","10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.","7","7 July 2017"
"darapjohnson","First time I watched this I fell asleep about 50+ minutes in because I just didn't find it as good as Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, or hell, even The Amazing Spider-man and I found Tom Holland's character in general, annoying and too childlike in comparison to the other Spider-men. It just didn't appeal to me... at all, whatsoever. The only reason I forced myself to watch it now is because i'm on a MCU marathon so I finished it. It just was not good for me personally. Although I can appreciate the CGI and soundtrack and other stuff which spikes it up to 3 stars I guess, but meh. Also that villain was one of the most boring characters to ever hit the screen in an MCU movie (can't even remember his name, that should tell you everything right there)","10","25 September 2022"
"BA_Harrison","I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.","9","4 July 2019"
"pyrocitor","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans ""or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno""), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring (""my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame"") is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10","10","15 July 2017"

"Anurag-Shetty","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late. Spider-Man: Homecoming is a spectacular film. It is the best Spider- Man movie, yet. Director Jon Watts makes sure that the audience sees a different side of Spider-Man, that wasn't seen in any of the previous big screen incarnations of the character. I love the fact that the focus was on Peter Parker's high school life, this time around. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The Washington Monument scene, the Staten Island ferry scene & the climax are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are mind blowing. The 3D is eye-popping. I love the fact that we get to see Spidey's iconic red & blue suit from the comics, complete with the web glider & expressive eye visors. The background score by Michael Giacchino sticks with you, long after the film ends. The performances make the movie, flawless. Tom Holland is the star of the show, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland portrays Peter Parker's awkwardness & vulnerability & Spider-Man's wit & flexibility, with ease & panache. Michael Keaton is outstanding as Adrian Toomes/Vulture. Keaton's Vulture is the best villain in all six standalone Spider-Man movies, along with Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Marisa Tomei is brilliant as May Parker. Jon Favreau is superb as Happy Hogan. Zendaya is awesome as Michelle. Jacob Batalon is fantastic as Ned. Laura Harrier is excellent as Liz. Tony Revolori is hilarious as Flash. Donald Glover, Bokeem Woodbine, Hannibal Buress, Kenneth Choi, Martin Starr, Michael Chernus, Michael Mando, Logan Marshall-Green & Jennifer Connelly are good as, Aaron Davis, Herman Schultz/Shocker #2, Coach Wilson, Principal Morita, Mr. Harrington, Phineas Mason/The Tinkerer, Mac Gargan, Jackson Brice/Shocker #1 & Karen/Suit Lady, respectively. The Marvel Cinematic Universe can do no wrong. I can't wait for Spidey's return, in Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Spider-Man: Homecoming is a must watch, for everyone. Swing by your favorite theater, immediately!","7","7 July 2017"
"BoilerYor","Marvel Studios is the cinematic equivalent of McDonald's. Crushing any creativity and selling their version of Happy Meals at record quantity but no quality.Despite my gripes with the Raimi trilogy, it showed at least some, if misguided, sense of authorship. This however is bland and forgettable. Everything from acting to directing is average at best. Even Michael Keaton, who is usually great and can play a good villain: see Desperate Measures and Pacific Heights, is just phoning it in.Completely forgettable.","10","27 August 2021"
"MLDinTN","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.","8","10 March 2018"
"claudio_carvalho","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice.

"Sleepin_Dragon","A young Peter Parker battles the everyday problems of a teenage student, whilst his alter ego, Spiderman battles a major threat.I am surprised to see so many one and ten star reviews for this film, I honestly don't quite see how it could create such passion for or against, for me it was a pretty decent money, but in the grand scheme of Spider man movies, many are superior, some are decidedly inferior.I wonder if this one will be influenced by age, I think a younger audience will have more love for it, I think some mature viewers may find it a little childish at times, some of the dialogue will have you cringing.Initially I was expecting someone to give Spiderman a little spidey dummy/pacifier, initially I found it frustrating, but I'm glad I stick with it, as it does improve. The ending is the best bit, I think you really do see Spiderman mature.Tom Holland was very good I thought, a fine, energetic performance, the script was challenging at times.Some nice action sequences, and a pretty good story, I did appreciate the acting of Michael Keaton, and the impact of Robert Downey Junior, I wish we'd seen more of him.6/10.","10","20 December 2022"
"WeAreLive","It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.","9","13 March 2018"

"cruise01","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.","9","8 July 2017"

"filipemanuelneto","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.Tom Holland is a convincing Peter Parker, quite confused about what to do and eager to prove himself before Tony Stark. The actor did a good job and managed to give us a Parker that oscillates between instinctive heroism and insecurity, typical of a boy in his teens. Robert Downey Jr. brings us, as usual in the Marvel film franchise, the iconic Iron Man, which he had already made in other films and which he managed to make self-centered and a demanding mentor. Michael Keaton brought a complex and psychologically rich villain to life, far more than most I've seen in films of this genre, which was extremely positive. I also enjoyed watching the work of, Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau.Innovative and ingenious, the film does not explain the character's origins and goes directly to what matters, functioning almost as a sequel to previous films made with this character. At first it was difficult for me to swallow this mixture of comedy and cartoons, and some of the jokes in the film had no effect on me. There is also, clearly, an attempt to moderate the action and fighting scenes that guided previous films and to offer less but good, with good CGI and very realistic visual effects. Excellent photography with vivid colors and good play of light and shadow help to make this film pleasing to the eyes and ears.",NA,"31 January 2020"

Michael Keaton makes a amazing transition from DC to Marvel, as he goes from playing Batman to the Vulture. The cherry on top is Laura Harrier, whom I think has a great future ahead of her. She is my favorite Spider-Man love interest. Gwen was good, but not fulfilled enough, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) was just the worst. But Liz Allan is my favorite.

"aharmas","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after ""Wonder Woman"", the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three ""Ironman"" and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to ""do something for the world, fighting those bad guys"". It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his ""cute"" aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful.

"the_legend_27","Jon Watts (Director of Clown and Cop Car) perfects the character and charm of Spider-Man that we all love from the comics without doing disservice to either fans of both the Raimi and Amazing Spider-Man franchises with a fun superhero movie oozing with joy with its great cast and characters, big and small, as well as an 'amazing' performance from Tom Holland who brilliantly combines what Maguire and Garfield brought to the character by truly demonstrating the differences and similarities between the awkward nerd Peter Parker and the quippy crime fighting Spider-Man. The film also gives many critics of Marvel's lack of great villains what they want most, a relatable villain that is as, if not more, interesting than the hero itself and not only is great adversary physically but also psychologically and we see this with Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of the Vulture. What Spider-Man: Homecoming does best, however, is its attention to detail and world building put into the town of Queens, which feels more real and believable than any other fictional world we have seen in the MCU, making Spider-Man: Homecoming one of the best chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and another great example for future superhero movies to learn from.",NA,"21 July 2017"
"Dr_Sagan","Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably, because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that ""goofy"" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy. BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you must look elsewhere...",NA,"27 September 2017"
"Aaron1375","I am not going to lie, I really like Spider-man, he is my favorite comic book hero. So, this film could be considered bad by most people, but I am still going to like it. Heck, I even enjoyed the two James Garfield Spider-man films. Here, we have another reboot, but this time it is a bit different as this Spider-man has already been introduced to us in last year's Captain America: Civil War. It also does something different than other superhero stories as we do not have to witness the whole origin thing again! I was relieved as I did not want to see Uncle Ben die again and I do think t hat most of us are pretty familiar with how Peter Parker became Spider-man. This time we are also treated to a fairly upbeat Spider-man film as well. No tragic death after tragic death in this one as this one maintains a more positive vibe throughout. Which is good for me as I had to deal with a very harsh personal tragedy and I really do not care to deal with more, even in film. It is strange that they seem to insist on making Peter Parker younger each time though seeing as how in the main cannon of comics he was maybe in high school briefly at the start as when I was reading it he was in college and working for the Daily Bugle; however, at least the high school he is in is one for more intelligent kids so they at least factor in his intelligence.The story first starts off during the aftermath of the first Avengers film as a crew that seems to salvage and clean up debris is on the scene. The government takes over though leaving Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his crew in a very bad state as he put everything he had in this cleanup. He ends up keeping some stuff that they had gotten the previous day and thus he and his gang begin stealing the high tech weaponry. Flash years later and Peter Parker is under the tutelage of Tony Stark, well actually he is under the tutelage of Happy Hogan. He eagerly awaits another mission after the battle with Captain America and he eagerly awaits the end of each school day so he can go out and fight crime which oftentimes takes the form of stopping bike thieves and accidentally stopping people from trying to get into their own car. However, he soon runs into some thieves robbing an ATM using advanced weaponry and soon he will come face to face with the Vulture! He also tries to woe the girl he likes as Homecoming is soon.This one was a fun movie as Spider-man is in the Marvel universe. So we get some comedy in there and we get some really good action sequences. A minor complaint I do have is that Spider-man's spidey sense did not really seem to play that big of a role in his powers. Tom Holland did a very good job as Spider-man as he looked the part of Peter Parker and he talked the role of Spider-man. I always thought Tobey was a great Peter Parker, but lacked the trash talking ability of Spider-man while Andrew could trash talk, but he just did not have a Peter Parker vibe. Keaton was great as the Vulture, it was cool seeing him in another superhero film and he made a really good villain. They also had the Shocker in this one and I loved his inclusion as I always thought he should have been in other Spider-man films as a secondary villain. They also hinted that the Scorpion may be coming! So I enjoyed this Spider-man film. I liked it about the same as Guardians Volume 2 which I also enjoyed immensely. Then again, I like comic book films and I like most superheros. There really is not a superhero offhand I can think of that I do not like. I do prefer the Marvel universe over the DC one, but I like DC too. This one had everything one comes to expect from a marvel film as it had good humor and good action. I liked Tony Stark's inclusion in the film and I like how he mentors Peter and is at the same time his same arrogant and off the wall self. It was just a fun film and I really thought it had the spirit of Spider-man within it even though things did not go exactly as they do in the comics. As I stated in my Logan review though, in comics there are different existences and in the Marvel cinematic one Peter is a high school teen who has to balance out his studies with fighting crime!",NA,"11 July 2017"

"Platypuschow","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image",NA,"20 October 2017"
"ericstevenson","I'm not going to say that this has the best Spider-Man because that honor still belongs to Tobey Maguire. My only complaint with this film is that it didn't show Spider-Man's origin. I thought they were at least going to show flashbacks of how it happened. Still, Spider-Man can have many different stories in all these iterations. This movie boasts of awesome action scenes, many heartfelt moments and tons of funny jokes. It's basically everything a good film should have. It's great to have Tony Stark contribute to the story. Captain America appears too, but not in a way you'd expect.It's amazing we've had this many iterations in 15 years. The villain, the Vulture is never referred to by name. It was weird seeing Michael Keaton as a supervillain when he played a superhero in ""Batman"". I thought maybe the scene in the middle with Spider-Man bringing the boat together was a reference to the scene where he stops the bus in ""Spider-Man 2"". While I still find that the best Spider-Man movie, this is a close second. The funniest part was when he had that deep voice in interrogation mode. Maybe not that much heart, but still tons of fun and everything you'd want in a Spider-Man movie. ***1/2",NA,"10 July 2017"
"RforFilm","Look out folks, we've got another Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters! While most are excited to see their friendly neighborhood hero back for another reboot, I bet a lot are groaning, questioning why another retelling of the web-slinger is necessary. It has to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney has been hitting home run after home run with the rest of the capes, Spider-Man was one of the few characters (at least with movie rights) that Disney couldn't work with. The rights remained with Sony and Colombia due to contracts that were drawn years before Disney bought marvel Comics. After lower ratings and marginal box office grossings that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 brought in, Disney and Sony sat down to discuss what to do with him. An agreement was made that Sony and Disney would share the character and allow him to join the other Avengers within the same universe, under the condition that Spider-Man would be given a fresh start. He made his debut in Captain America: Civil War with his powers already intact, and was considered one of the best surprises. Now with Spider-Man: Homecoming, we get to see the young characters expansion within the New York streets of Queens.After the events in Captain America: Civil War, we see that Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is trying to balance his high school life and trying out the Spider-Man suit that was made by Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) to fight crime in his neighborhood. Despite being powerful and quick, Parker is cocky and urging to become an avenger, despite the protests of his superior Happy Hogan (played by Jon Faverau) to stay grounded. Parker does his best to keep his regular life on check, especially under the eyes of his aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei) and his one friend who knows his identity, Ned (played by Jacob Batalon).While Parker is stopping an ATM robbery, he notices that the crooks are using high tech weapons and manage to get away. When he encounters them again and tries to intervene, Spider-Man's naiveté gets him hurt and has to be rescued by Iron Man. Parker manages to trace the weapons back to a salvager/engineer Adrian Toomes (played by Michael Keaton) who has used a combination of alien and Stark technology to build himself a set of mechanical wings to become ""The Vulture"". Can Spider-Man impress Stark when he attempts to stop these guys and keep up his high school image?I'm pleased to say that the title of ""Homecoming"" is exactly what this story stands for, as Spider- Man has made a well adjusted return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story made the right decision to take the character back to high school to show us a different Spider-Man; one that's more vulnerable and likely to mess up. Seeing this has made me realize just how overly-perfect the Sam Rami and Mark Webb movies were in portraying the web-slinger. It's not a bad thing, but I think people are going to relate to this Spider-Man more then they did for Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Speaking of which, how was Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man? He was really good. He seems to be the first Spider-Man to finally have a good balance between the characters. In fact, he may be the best I've seen at playing Peter Parker, as I felt it was more about him as a teenager rather then a super hero. Michael Keaton makes a nice return to superhero movies (after playing Batman) as a villain. He has a bit more humanity them some of the previous Marvel heroes and your often seeing his side of the story and how circumstance may be the greatest villain of all.The tone of Spider-Man: Homecoming feels just as young as our Peter Parker. I can't help but feel that they took some cues from Deadpool and made this a bit more playful then your usual Marvel movie. This comes from the constant jokes, a John Hughes-like tone, and an entertaining end credits that make me want to wait till towards the end. I'm glad to say that this is up there with Spider-Man 2 as one of the best. I'll give this nine Spider wings out of ten. Part of me wishes that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still playing as I would totally see that as a double feature with Spider-Man: Homecoming. But on it's own, it's a fantastic Spider-Man movie that should win over doubters who weren't sure about another incarnation. If he's your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, then give him a chance.",NA,"7 July 2017"
