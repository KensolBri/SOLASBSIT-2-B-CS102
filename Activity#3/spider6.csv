"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","7","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","7","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","7","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","7","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","8","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","10","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","10","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","8","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","9","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","6","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","6","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","6","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","9","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","7","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","10","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","8","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","10","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","10","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","10","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","10","8 May 2007"
"bevo-13678","I like the bit where the other spider man creates inner turmoil.","3","6 August 2021"
"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","8","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","8","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","8","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","7","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","7","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","7","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","7","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","8","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","10","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","10","5 January 2020"

"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","9","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","6","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","6","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","6","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","9","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","7","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","10","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","8","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","10","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","10","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","10","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","10","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","3","8 May 2007"
"bevo-13678","I like the bit where the other spider man creates inner turmoil.","8","6 August 2021"
"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","8","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie.

"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","7","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","7","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","7","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","7","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","8","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","10","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","10","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","8","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","9","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","6","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","6","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","6","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","9","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","7","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","10","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","8","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","10","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","10","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","10","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","10","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","3","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","8","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","8","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","7","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","7","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","7","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","7","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","8","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","10","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","10","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","8","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","9","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","6","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","6","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","6","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","9","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","7","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","10","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","8","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","10","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","10","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","10","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","10","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","3","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","8","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","8","8 May 2007"
"bevo-13678","I like the bit where the other spider man creates inner turmoil.","8","6 August 2021"
"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","7","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","7","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","7","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","7","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","8","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","10","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","10","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","8","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","9","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","6","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","6","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","6","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","9","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","7","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","10","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","8","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","10","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","10","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","10","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","10","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","3","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","8","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","8","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","8","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","7","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","7","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","7","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","8","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","10","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","10","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","8","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","9","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","6","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice.

"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","9","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","7","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","10","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","8","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","10","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","10","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","10","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","10","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","3","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","8","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","8","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","8","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","7","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","7","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","7","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","8","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","10","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","10","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","8","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","9","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","6","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","6","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","6","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","9","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","7","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","10","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","8","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","10","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","10","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","10","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","10","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","3","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","8","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","8","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","8","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","7","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","7","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","7","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","8","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","10","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","10","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","8","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","9","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","6","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","6","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","6","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","9","5 January 2020"

"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","10","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","8","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","10","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","10","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","10","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","10","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","3","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","8","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","8","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","8","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","7","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","7","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","7","8 May 2007"
"bevo-13678","I like the bit where the other spider man creates inner turmoil.","7","6 August 2021"
"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","8","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","10","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","10","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","8","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","9","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","6","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","6","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","6","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","9","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","7","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","10","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","8","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","10","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","10","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","10","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","10","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","3","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","8","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","8","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","8","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","7","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","7","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","7","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","7","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","10","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","10","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","8","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","9","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","6","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","6","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","6","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","9","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","7","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","10","5 January 2020"

"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","10","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","10","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","10","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","10","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","3","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","8","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","8","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","8","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","7","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","7","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","7","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","7","25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","8","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","10","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","8","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","9","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","6","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","6","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","6","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","9","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","7","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","10","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","8","5 January 2020"
"James0987","Is this a great movie? No not really, but it is a very enjoyable movie to watch that has been memed to all hell for good reason. There are a lot of interesting directing choices in this film but I've never seen anything else's like it.10/10 would watch again.","10","22 December 2021"
"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","10","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","10","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","10","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","3","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","8","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","8","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.","8","4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","7","13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.","7","15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","7","10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!","7","5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend.

They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""","10","8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","8","4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris, and Thomas Haden Church did a good job.Topher Grace (Eddie Brock) aka venom - not such a great job.Conclusion: great movie. Worth a re-watch.","9","8 July 2020"
"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.","6","6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.","6","20 January 2011"
"AaronCapenBanner","Third and last(?) film in this trilogy isn't as good as the first two, mainly because the plot is overly contrived, but I still found this to be very entertaining and filled with good action and character development.Plot has Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane threatened by the simultaneous arrival of Super-villains Sandman(Thomas Haden Church, good performance) and mysterious alien black goo that latches onto Peter and develops his dark side, which nearly wrecks his life, and rival reporter Topher Grace, who also comes into contact with the alien menace, and becomes Venom.Large scale action climax is still satisfying and fitting, with Peter and Mary Jane back on the path to mutual happiness in a bright future together...I hope, since the planned Part IV was scrapped unfortunately...A shame.","6","25 August 2013"
"0U","And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","9","24 February 2020"
"ivo-cobra8","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10","7","6 December 2012"
"gavin6942","This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","10","17 April 2011"
"Ch4ndler_B1ng","This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You'll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn't done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst's MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn't flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""","8","21 December 2021"
"OMTR","The third and final episode of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy is just as perfect as the first two parts. Spidey and his loved ones plunge into darkness, go the distance, and make real friendship and love triumph in the end. Because ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and ""Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside of us, we always have a choice. It is our choices that makes us who we are, and we always have a choice to do what's right ~ Let love and forgiveness reign.""","10","5 January 2020"

"kristianlepka","Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2.","10","14 December 2021"
"ccthemovieman-1","I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","10","4 November 2007"
"TheLittleSongbird","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","3","16 January 2010"
"dbborroughs","Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise. While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","8","6 May 2007"
"Special-K88","Third entry has Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-Man fighting what could possibly be the greatest battle of his life. The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","8","8 May 2007"
"Norway1","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)","8","7 May 2007"
"LennyRenquist","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.",NA,"4 May 2007"
"mstomaso","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.",NA,"13 May 2007"
"spooly_montana","When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.",NA,"15 May 2007"
"claudio_carvalho","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is absolutely happy and fascinated with the success and fame of the Spider-Man. His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")",NA,"10 November 2007"
"darthheimdall","I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.How the movie stands on its own:Plotwise-The primary plot is Peter Parker struggling with the arrogant and aggressive desires given to him by the alien being that has created his notorious ""black suit"". There are numerous subplots in the movie (Peter's ego affecting his relationship with MJ, the discovery that the Sandman was his Uncle's real killer, Harry blaming him for the death of his father, and a rival reporter in Eddie Brock, plus romantic attention from Gwen Stacey), but all of these either cause him to accept the alien's powers, or are aggravated by his use of the black suit, so they are all tied in nicely to the main plot.Characters-Maguire is able to portray Peter's darker side while keeping his ""nerdy"" core. Dunst is great at portraying a jealous MJ. Franco is fantastic at being an obsessive, vengeful Harry. The versions of the Sandman and Venom portrayed by Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace, respectively, are different from the comic versions, I am told, but within the scope of the movie, they are well done, especially considering the lack of screen time they each get. Here, the Sandman is a sad, reluctant villain who stoops to crime to get money to find a cure for his daughter, and Eddie Brock/Venom is a cocky, devious ""evil twin nerd"" version of Peter Parker. Bruce Campbell as a French host is hilarious. The actress who played Gwen Stacey doesn't get as big of a part as she deserves, but she works with what she has. Setting-New York City, so it's obviously good. Also loved the American Flag in the background before the final battle-USA! USA!Dialogue-Funny moments such as J. Jonah Jameson being buzzed to take his blood pressure medication more than make up for cheesy lines said during a break-up scene on a bridge in a park.Flaws: -The villains, since there are three of them, aren't as well developed as they are in the first two movies. In particular, Venom needed more screen time (and a MUCH closer relationship to Gwen) to give him more of a motive for hating Spiderman. This is a shame, considering how well Doc Oc was characterized in the second movie. -Some of the emotional moments (i.e. the bridge break-up) are overacted, making them somewhat cheesy. -MAJOR SPOILER: Harry changes sides way too quickly after a less-than-minor character tells him the truth about what happened to his father. END OF SPOILER.The good elements of this movie far outweigh the bad elements, and it is honestly the best movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a brilliant theme of how liberating forgiveness is and how poisoning revenge is in contrast. There are rumors of a fourth movie coming out; all I have to say is, if Sam Raimi, Maguire, Dunst, and other members of the original cast are still in it, I am SO there!",NA,"5 May 2007"
"HotToastyRag","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",NA,"25 February 2020"
"leplatypus","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They ""clean"" my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the ""pulse"" Because the ""spirit"" of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the ""burglar"". While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled ""authors"" movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of ""The Reaping"" for a proof""), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. ""Enough said!""",NA,"8 May 2007"

"imajestr","There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.",NA,"4 May 2007"
"nahumthebest","I just re-watched Venom (2018) and then I decided to re-watch Spiderman 3 so I did. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It was nice to see Spiderman become dark and evil for a little bit. I was not happy with the main villain Sandman - I mean, that is just a childish idea for a villain; what was Stan Lee thinking in 1963?Venom was cool in this movie but of course nowhere as cool as his own movie in 2018.The ending was tragic, which I had completely forgotten about. I felt the emotional connection shared by Peter, his girl, and his best friend.Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, J. K.

"Skip_4591","**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.This is also the funniest spider-man film. There are a lot of hilarious moments in it, and the best part is that they don't take away from the slightly darker tone of the film. They make it even more enjoyable than it already is.I loved the villains. Sandman was great, the New Goblin was great, and Venom was just absolutely spectacular. Topher Grace in an evil role was genius.Speaking of which, Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, has some really awesome moments as well, and the transformation sequence from him into Venom was just great. The final battle scenes at the end with him are some of the best scenes in the series. He did an outstanding job in his role.Probably my favorite scene is the jazz club scene, where the more evil and edgier Peter Parker shows off his dancing talent (and later gets a little violent with some people). It was funny, shocking, and just plain entertaining. The evil Peter scenes are some of the best in the movie.The special effects were outstanding to say the least. There were, as usual, some parts here and there where they weren't as top-notch as they could have been, but for the most part, they were outstanding.Some people argued that the film was a little too long, but I think it was too short. It could have been even better if there were more Sandman, Venom, and evil Spidey scenes. Maybe one more Goblin attack as well. But what we got is still very awesome! Perhaps there will be an extended edition in the future, like what they did with Spiderman 2.There are only two flaws I can think of in the film. The first is that there is, in the middle of the film, a long period of time where we don't see Peter Parker in his Spiderman outfit. Now I didn't mind this, I thought it was great...but the problem is that this period of time might affect my future viewings of the film. Still, the first time I saw it, i loved that section of the film, I thought it was gorgeous.The other flaw is that in the final battle, some more fighting with Venom would have been nice. I mean there is a lot of fighting in the final battle between Spiderman and Venom, but the character of Venom was so well done in the movie that even more fighting would have better satisfied me. If it were also a little more violent, that would have been better too because it could have given the darker tone more justice. There is still a chance of an extended edition, though, and the final battle is still awesome.All in all, this movie was an outstanding ride, a true masterpiece, and one of the most entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. I'm not sure whether this is my favorite spidey film, but it probably is. It's an amazing movie, well worth my time. Go see it! I give it a 10 out of 10.",NA,"6 May 2007"
"robyn-710-767167","The first one in the series introduced the characters perfectly.The second one was quite well to keep it going The final one was really great and epic. I really enjoyed the way they ended the movie, although it was a little sad. I found the way they summed up everything to be perfect. I actually cried many times during the movie.The way the characters interacted with each other to solve things was perfect. I really was impressed that many of the characters didn't know about spiderman. I thought it was very wise to only reveal it to the critical people, and even if the train scene in the second movie, they didn't know the kid.This will be one of the many movie series that will be close to me, always.Rated 8/10 for one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie.",NA,"20 January 2011"
