"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","8","8 October 2005"
"safenoe","Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched, I was entranced by Spider-Man and I can't believe it doesn't even rate an 8 on IMDb. Say what? Spider-Man has heart, it has feeling, the emotion, it has it all. Willem Dafoe was born to play the Green Goblin for sure.","10","25 February 2022"
"ronbell-23984","Really good movie, I enjoyed the whole Trilogy with Toby Maguire but this was the best of the 3. Willem Dafoe made an excellent villain as the Green Goblin. Excellent super hero movie.","9","27 October 2020"
"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","9","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","9","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","9","5 May 2002"
"0U","That movie starts the string of the spider man that I'm grown with and raise the bar really high for the next super hero movie which comes soon after it. This part is really good synthesized.

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","8","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","10","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","7","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.

"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman. Peter Parker takes off his clothes while running just like Clark Kent. It is a nod that the modern superhero genre started with Richard Donner's Superman.","10","25 November 2021"

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","10","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","9","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","8","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","9","8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","9","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","9","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","9","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","8","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","9","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","10","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","10","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","9","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","10","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","10","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman. Peter Parker takes off his clothes while running just like Clark Kent. It is a nod that the modern superhero genre started with Richard Donner's Superman.","10","25 November 2021"

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","8","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","10","26 February 2022"
"dannyclyde","The true story of Spiderman, the only true beginning of the one and original Spiderman in my opinion. Despite the year it is a screaming film with its special effects.","9","2 March 2022"
"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","9","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","10","8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","9","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","8","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","10","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","9","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","10","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","7","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","10","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","9","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","9","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","10","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","9","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","10","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","9","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","9","8 October 2005"
"safenoe","Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched, I was entranced by Spider-Man and I can't believe it doesn't even rate an 8 on IMDb. Say what? Spider-Man has heart, it has feeling, the emotion, it has it all. Willem Dafoe was born to play the Green Goblin for sure.","9","25 February 2022"
"ronbell-23984","Really good movie, I enjoyed the whole Trilogy with Toby Maguire but this was the best of the 3. Willem Dafoe made an excellent villain as the Green Goblin. Excellent super hero movie.","8","27 October 2020"
"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","10","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","9","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","10","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","10","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","9","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","10","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","10","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","9","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","8","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","10","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man.

He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","8","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","10","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","9","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","9","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","9","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","8","8 October 2005"
"safenoe","Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched, I was entranced by Spider-Man and I can't believe it doesn't even rate an 8 on IMDb. Say what? Spider-Man has heart, it has feeling, the emotion, it has it all. Willem Dafoe was born to play the Green Goblin for sure.","10","25 February 2022"
"ronbell-23984","Really good movie, I enjoyed the whole Trilogy with Toby Maguire but this was the best of the 3. Willem Dafoe made an excellent villain as the Green Goblin. Excellent super hero movie.","9","27 October 2020"
"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","10","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","7","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","9","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","10","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","10","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","9","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","10","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man.

He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","9","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","9","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","9","19 June 2012"
"Calicodreamin","The first of the modern Spider-Man and in my opinion the best, Toby is the OG. Storyline is well developed and the characters are well cast. The leads have good chemistry even with the villain. Effects look great for their age.","9","17 August 2022"
"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","9","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","8","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","9","8 October 2005"
"safenoe","Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched, I was entranced by Spider-Man and I can't believe it doesn't even rate an 8 on IMDb. Say what?

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","7","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","9","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","10","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","10","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","9","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","8","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","10","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","8","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","10","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman. Peter Parker takes off his clothes while running just like Clark Kent. It is a nod that the modern superhero genre started with Richard Donner's Superman.","9","25 November 2021"

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","10","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","9","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","9","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","10","8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","10","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","10","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","9","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","10","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","9","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","10","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","9","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","9","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man.

He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","9","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","9","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","10","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","7","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","9","8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","10","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","9","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","8","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","10","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","10","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","8","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","10","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","9","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","10","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","9","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","8","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","10","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","7","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","10","8 October 2005"
"safenoe","Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was launched, I was entranced by Spider-Man and I can't believe it doesn't even rate an 8 on IMDb. Say what? Spider-Man has heart, it has feeling, the emotion, it has it all. Willem Dafoe was born to play the Green Goblin for sure.","10","25 February 2022"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","8","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","9","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","10","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","10","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","9","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","9","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","9","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","9","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man.

He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","9","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","10","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","7","19 June 2012"

A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","10","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","10","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","9","8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","9","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","8","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","10","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","9","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","10","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","9","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","8","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","10","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman. Peter Parker takes off his clothes while running just like Clark Kent. It is a nod that the modern superhero genre started with Richard Donner's Superman.","9","25 November 2021"

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","10","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","7","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","10","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".","9","19 May 2012"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10","8","5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.","10","8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??","8","15 December 2002"
"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.","10","28 February 2006"
"Aaron1375","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.","9","2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.","9","5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""","9","1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.","9","24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.","9","8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.","10","18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.","9","16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.","10","9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man.

He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.","9","2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.","10","26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.","10","19 June 2012"

"jaredpahl","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.95/100","8","5 June 2016"
"nickmesafilms","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.10/10",NA,"5 May 2002"
"MaxBorg89","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.",NA,"8 October 2005"

"Doylenf","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects.

"Hitchcoc","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents.

I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.",NA,"2 September 2005"
"MissCzarChasm","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-ManThe other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack.",NA,"5 May 2002"

"TxMike","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.No SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action. **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now! It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man."" Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see.""",NA,"1 November 2002"
"Sleepin_Dragon","Peter Parker, a shy, slightly awkward teenager is bitten by a unique spider, after a tough night he wakes up with impressive new powers.For me, this is still the most complete and enjoyable Spider-Man movie, it really is an excellent, exciting and complete film. It's superior to most of the films that came after.The tone is perfect, it's goofy enough, but there's enough action and content to appeal to viewers of all ages. Even for a superhero novice like me, it's an awesome watch.The story is fantastic, I love that we get the origins, Peter's development, transformation, and subsequent notoriety, and of course no Spiderman film would be complete without a classic villain, and of course we get The Green Goblin, played to perfection by Willem Dafoe.Tobey Maguire, for me he's the best of the modern day incarnations, he's excellent, and truly looks the part.Incredibly watchable, 9/10.",NA,"24 December 2022"
"TheLittleSongbird","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",NA,"8 May 2009"

"PedroPires90","This film is so good! Like a real film, not as an amusement park.From a time when superhero films could be made without jokes every 20 seconds. From a time when they cared about great scores (epic this one!), adapting the music to each moment (even horror vibes in some scenes, like the attempted rape). From a time when they cared about relationships, real feelings and they looked like real people with big character development. Raimi was not rushing anything. He was not afraid to use silence when it was necessary. He knows what pace is and the visual effects are here to support something, not to be the main star.All these people could belong to the real world. I think that is what I love the most about this film. They are not joking about shagging the aunt in the middle of an epic fight. They could be us. In our world. I really miss this feeling instead of travelling every time to a fake and childish universe.",NA,"18 December 2021"
"generationofswine","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride.",NA,"16 November 2016"
"clydestuff","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.",NA,"9 April 2004"
"Prismark10","The movie that gave the fledgling MCU that their superheroes line up could soar if handled right.It is easy to overlook just how big Spider-Man was at the box office and superhero movies could be fun.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school student people make fun of. He has always liked his next door neighbour Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly notices him.His best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) whose father is industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe.)On a school field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon develops special arachnid based powers.After the death of his Uncle Ben, Peter soon realises that to really be Spider-Man. He has to learn that with great powers come great responsibilities. He saves people as Spider-Man while Peter Parker gets a job with the Daily Bugle as a freelance photographer.Norman Osborn loses the grip in his company and so tries out one of his inventions. He becomes the crazed Green Goblin and comes after Spider-Man.Director Sam Raimi better known for his horror movies, makes a family friendly film with dark edges and humour. He is aided by Dafoe's maniacal performance. Raimi also knows how to handle the CGI special effects and makes good use of the New York locations.Maguire has the right amount of boyishness, there is the now iconic scene as the upside down Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane with his lips showing.There are even a few references to Superman.

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this.",NA,"2 June 2018"
"ciobanualin-94020","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy it's going to be my favourite one. It has a sad and emotional storyline, great special effects for their time, great acting and nice action. This trilogy it's also a little bit darker and more realistic than the actual Spider-Man trilogy, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker. It's maybe the third or fourth time that I am watching this one and I have to say that it has such an enormous sentimental value, because it's one of the trilogies that I have grew up with.",NA,"26 February 2022"

"joetufano719","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up.",NA,"19 June 2012"
