"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance.

"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance.

"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance.

"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
"tevernaugh-76446","How does Aang make it through the entire season and never even attempted to learn how to wate-rbend??....I thought the series started off really well. The costumes were designed quite poorly, they looked cosplay-ish and even then they're deep in battle they never even seem to get dirty. The animals were designed extremely well and made the series a bit more bearable. The acting wasn't terrible but the over-acting worsened as the series went on and by the end seemed soap opera-ish. In the first few episodes they made minor changes to the storyline, which is expected but half way through they take it entirely too far and started forcing different stories together and started making abilities that are supposed to be unique and special available to every character. They also made Aang seem lazy. He didn't even try to learn waterbending because he thinks one of the past avatars would take over and do it for him. 1/3 of the series is over and Aang is just as untrained as he was 100 years ago. I hope they do better next time around.","5","2 March 2024"
"poseyfan","At long last, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender has arrived. And I must say, I didn't necessarily care for it too much. This calls for the classic line: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.I wasn't swayed one way or the other. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It kind of just exists. I couldn't help but compare everything in the show to the original cartoon. (One of the best TV shows ever in my book.) Everything was done in its shadow.At one point I was watching with my brothers and we were like ""this is kind of mid. We should just watch the cartoon."" And that's what we did. I think that tells you all you need to know.I heard someone say that this was on par with Disney's recent live action remakes. Mostly soulless remakes. And I would have to agree.The best part of this show is the casting I would say. The acting is just ok though.Overall, I didn't care too much for it.","6","27 February 2024"
"ramosaral","First things first, they did a top notch job with visual effects. Bending techniques, the way the elements connect with the bodies of the characters, the places all look wonderful. They bring the world alive. However, that is not what ATLA is about. In order for the characters to have their development we need to see their interaction, we need to see their characters, that is why we love the characters in the cartoon. Here the characters are all over the place. There is no goofiness, they are all too serious which bothers.Also, showing things subtly, inserting the message between the lines is the strength of the cartoon. Here they deliver ling winded, empty, and bland speeches that do not move us.","3","22 February 2024"
"MissSimonetta","I'm too exhausted with these pointless live action remakes of animated classics to get angry anymore. This Netflix redo of AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER is at best competent, with handsome production design and costuming. Storywise, it strips out the humor of the original, leaving us with grim imitations of the characters we so loved. The sadsack reimagining of the feisty Katara is particularly horrid.The acting is spotty. Some of the performers are pretty good, but so many of the line readings come off like community theater. Where's the passion?While not the fiasco the previous live action feature was, this new AVATAR is just pointless. Yeah it's not bad, but why settle for not bad when the original show was great? I'd rather just rewatch the old one for the hundredth time.","6","27 February 2024"
"pollereulogy","I understand that adapting a cartoon series scene by scene into a live adaptation is impractical. However, removing the lead character's pivotal arc, which was integral to the essence of the original story, weakens the storytelling. The Aang portrayed lacks the innocence and depth of the 12-year-old protagonist we grew to love; instead, he's presented as a young adult novel archetype warrior.Moreover, the characters seem to lack the comedic traits that defined them, resulting in scenes that feel devoid of emotion and overly somber.The direction feels stagnant, with characters rigidly placed and delivering exposition rather than engaging dynamically with the world around them.Numerous unnecessary changes detract from the impactful moments, surprising reveals, and character development that made the original series so compelling.While I appreciate the efforts put into the visuals and action sequences, they shouldn't be the sole focus of a production with such a substantial budget.","6","22 February 2024"
"seige-hound","The Netflix adaptation of Avatar is decent. It takes the core plot points, remixes them a little, and turns it into a slightly more mature-toned version. It's still family friendly, but more closely resembling a modern PG-13 superhero story than the PG original.My core complaints are the dialogue writing and the overall rush to get through the plot at the expense of deeper character development. There is a lot of fanservice, references to the Kyoshi books, a lot of action, and some small changes that I would argue are a little better than the original. However, those are at the expense of a deeper connection with the characters. The most well-developed characters are Aang and Zuko, but even they get a few of their core characteristics shaved off. Aang is a lot less goofy. He still acts like a kid and makes a few good jokes, but he isn't going on little sidequest adventures anymore. There's no elephant koi at Kyoshi Island and only a little cart surfing in Omashu. It's like they trimmed the fat and lost the flavour.Another issue is the dialogue. Especially in the first episode, the dialogue is very clumsy and exposition-heavy. A lot of telling, and not enough showing. It does improve a bit from episodes 2-8, but a rough start gives a very poor impression, unfortunately.In terms of the good, there is a decent amount. The choice to combine several plot elements from different episodes into one does work. For example, the third and fourth episodes in Omashu combine plot elements from ""The King of Omashu"", ""Jet"", ""The Northern Air Temple"" and surprisingly ""The Cave of Two Lovers"". You'd think I'm crazy, but it surprisingly works a lot better than it should.Then there's the fight scenes. While not as impactful as the animated show, the mix of top-tier CG effects with real choreography far surpasses most fantasy television, let alone the awful 2010 movie. There's no six earthbenders lifting a single pebble in this one, I can assure you of that. Waterbending feels a little weak in this show, but that's about it honestly.Overall, I'm impressed by the effort. It's not a perfect show, and it definitely isn't remotely better than the original, but I do think it's worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest when it comes out.","6","24 February 2024"
"Shiryu05","The mish-mash of story arcs, the rush of the entire first book, and the injustice they have done to several characters is hugely problematic, Hugely problematic!!!. While I liked seeing Kiyoshi early on, is it not supposed to be Roku as the first line of communication in the Avatar world?? It's almost like the guys who took over threw everything into a bowl, closed their eyes, and started picking events and characters to place in random order. I have waited years for this and am sorely disappointed by the final result. We still have two books to get through - I can only wonder how they will manage to mess that up...","5","22 February 2024"
"bestdesigns","I really loved the animated Series of Avatar, watched it so many times.Good things :
Although this season is much better than last flop movie but they missed so many things. CGI is much better, effects and fights are really good. Bending effects couldnt be better .Bad things :
The fun of characters was nowhere to be seen. Sokka was suppose to be a funny guy but they made him look so angry all the time. Same goes for bhoomi and Iroh.Story has been changed much enough that for person who never watched it wouldnt understand all of it.Dialogues and script is so cringe at some places. Specially dialogues of kitara and sokka. Unnecessarily trying to fit the dialogues of animated series without setting up the whole script .So its 6/10 for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"LovecraftKaiju","I usually type my review out long and detailed, but I love the OG show so much and after watching this adaptation I dont feel like bashing this just out of my love for the source material and cus this was bland.But if I was to TL;DR it - Same ol same ol,Same old Netflix being Netflix
just rushing motivations and character development scenes only to replace it with expository paragraph like stilted and flat dialogue just so they can get to that Key high points in the story without the actual soul of the journey.No humor or joy in scenes that were taken from OG but twisted around to be exposition, and where there is humor it feels mean spirited or cringe or just humor in places that makes no sense and confuses you more than anything so you dont really find it funny.This was disappointing and I feel empty.Far Better than the movie but that is a low bar to clear.Episode 6,7,8 sat in a MF bullet train just to get to the end, they could have easily made book 1 into Two seasons to get the characters fleshed out and added more emotion to the journey.Maybe I should thank the stars that they didnt shove more into it like they did for Yu Yu Hakusho Live action where they rammed 60 Episodes into 5 live action.Conclusion - People who have never seen this will love it since it is still adapting excellent and amazing storybeats from the OG. People who love the OG will not find any joy or soul in this.","5","22 February 2024"
"msmy98","I tried to like this, but with only 8 episodes there's not a lot to work with. The pacing is way too fast. If the movie didn't exist, this show would be getting all the hate that got.This season was supposed to be ""Book 1: Water"" and Aang didn't even attempt to learn it.The fact that they combined Jet + Teo and his father + Omashu all into one place is just ridiculous. We're supposed to see Aang and his friends go around the world exploring. There's supposed to be a balance between having fun + trying to focus on being the Avatar.The show just feels soulless to me. Some of the actors just feel like they're reading off a card. We barely get any time to bond with the characters and go through the journey with them. There's barely any character development. Thanks to Netflix only making 8 episodes.I really wish the directors or whoever nowadays STOP making shows with only 8-10 episodes a season and then making us wait 2-3 years for the next mediocre/bland season. That's exactly what's going to happen here for seasons 2 and 3.Overall, this show is disappointing and very rushed. People that haven't watched the cartoon (are there people who haven't??) need to forget this exists and just watch that instead. I have a feeling this is going to be like the Witcher, which Netflix ruined too (that was TRASH), just go play the game or read the book!","5","23 February 2024"
"katedodson148","The visuals are stunning - the effects are more impressive than I hoped. Unfortunately the dialogue leaves very little to the imagination. It is so literal! Good storytelling doesn't involve explaining to the audience the beginning middle and end in the first 20 minutes. Did Chat-GPT write this?! This reeks of studio execs having to get this out and not hiring/ supporting good writers. It cheapens the acting, and you lose the emotion, passion, and energy. The animated show wasn't about the sick fight scenes, but that's likely all you're gonna get from the live action.Kid who plays Zuko absolutely nails it. He couldn't have been cast better.","5","22 February 2024"
"antonbeukes-72702","Overall i enjoyed the show. The visual FX is a spectacle to watch and is rather nicely executed. The backdrops and sets were all very well done. The characters themselves give tribute the original story and characters but that is there my problems with the show begins.My biggest disappointment is that If you've watched the movie you could basically can skip this. The general story begins and ends the same.The writing at times felt forced, bland and ""kinda pausing for reaction"" bad. The actors themselves i liked, but nothing memorable either.The princess character and here entourage annoyed me to no end and the whole writing around her felt extremely forced. And while writing this part or this review I even lower my score from 7 to 6/10 so bad it was for me.","6","23 February 2024"
"halukkocadere","As a longtime fan of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I approached Netflix's adaptation with cautious optimism. Unfortunately, what I found was a series that fell short of capturing the magic and depth of the original.One of the most glaring issues was the lackluster dialogue. Lines that were iconic in the original series were either altered beyond recognition or delivered with a lack of emotion. For example, the pivotal moment when Aang emerges from the iceberg and speaks to Katara lacked the sincerity and charm that made the scene memorable. Instead of the heartfelt exchange between two characters meeting for the first time, it felt forced and flat.Aang: ""I need to ask you something. Please, come closer.""
Katara: ""What is it?""
Aang: ""Will you go penguin sledding with me?""Moreover, the adaptation failed to capture the essence of the characters. Aang, Katara, and Sokka lacked the depth and development that made them so beloved in the original series. Instead of complex and nuanced personalities, they felt one-dimensional and uninspired.Overall, Netflix's adaptation of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" missed the mark. While the visual effects were impressive and the production value was high, it ultimately failed to capture the heart and soul of the original series. Fans of the original will likely be disappointed by this lackluster adaptation.Rating: 6/10.","6","22 February 2024"
"catarinakulborg","The pilot fell a little flat to me, not gonna lie - but episode 2 was pretty awesome. :)
It's kind of like they hadn't fully warmed up for episode 1 or something, because the quality rose significantly after that.And look, let's just all accept that there's never going to be a live action adaptation of ATLA that truly satisfies us. We love the original too much, it's just an impossible standard to keep up with.This adaptation is no exception. It doesn't 'quite' live up to its source material. But there are still things to love about it.The stunning cgi being one of them. The bending looks super cool. We all remember how it took like four earth benders to lift a single rock in the Shyamalan movie, which was laughable. In this adaptation, they're just as skilled with their elements as in the original. I appreciate that. Overall, it's an aesthetically pleasing series.I do agree with some of the other reviewers in regard to the acting, however. Some of the actors come across as a little inexperienced, especially in the pilot.But in their defence, I think the script sort of makes it difficult for them. Some of the dialogue falls flat, even when it's supposed to be super impactful and dramatic. Plenty of telling-instead-of-showing. It gets a little weird at times. Especially when some of the scenes lack a background soundtrack, so it's just them having straight-to-the-point conversations to the sound of wind. (This, too, got better after that first episode.)And despite the acting perhaps lacking every now and again, I think they managed to stay much truer to the original characters this time around, which I'm so happy about. Sokka is so much funnier and wittier than in the movie. I actually RECOGNISE him. :)
Same goes for Aang. He's a lot better here than in the movie - brighter, happier, more prone to jokes. It's so great to see, after the super stern Sokka and very serious Aang in Shyamalan's version.I think they cast a really good Zuko, too! One of the best actors in the show, hands down.(The actress playing Katara could do with showing a bit more emotion though. Katara was always very expressive - here, she just sort of 'barely' reacts to what's going on around her, with only a few exceptions.)Unfortunately, episode 1 didn't make a great first impression, but I really urge you to give episode 2 a try. :)","8","22 February 2024"
"musings-morsels","It's far from perfect and the cartoon will always be superior. I appreciate it'll be near impossible to redo the cartoon frame by frame and even though it doesn't follow the cartoon exactly, it's done a damn good job at telling the story and extracting the essence and spirit of the original show. Visuals are stunning and the cast are all so fitting, some of the acting is questionable but for kids that haven't had a whole lot of experience in the industry, they didn't make me cringe, so in my eyes that's decent enough and forgivable. (They're much better than the Harry Potter kids when they first started out.) The fighting scenes are all amazing and makes bending look so powerful and devastating, really enjoyable. Most definitely doesn't deserve the 1 star that some of the reviewers have given it, it's a million times better than that movie that shall not be named and watching it brought a nostalgic tear to my eye. Well done Netflix, keep them coming and I hope the series gets a finish and not axed prematurely like a lot of good shows because I can't wait to meet Toph!","8","22 February 2024"
"roberto_di_bisceglia","The subtle nuances are completely gone. The iconic moment where Katara gets emotional and breaks the ice is now replaced with her trying to bend the boat back? The complexity or story telling that sets up their arcs from children to adults is now not there. Why did Aang just go up there to think about stuff? HE RAN AWAY. The whole point of his journey is accepting responsibility and that begins with running away!Aang's character is told through other people instead of him being it. What is happening with the writing? I'm so frustrated watching this.The only nice thing are the visuals, but apart from that it misses the heart and complexity that made the original iconic.Also it's just not funny. It is so scared to try to be offensive or say the wrong things or be disliked, it ended up being corporate and soulless.","5","23 February 2024"
"suchalad","If you finish episode 3 (amazing episode) and are not hooked by that point.....idk what to tell you or what more they could have done. Bizarrely, episode 3 has a lower user score than episode 1 and 2.... i think it's because of some of the changes they made to
the story but those changes were brilliant. It was impressive how they took characters and plot points from different episodes and weaved them together. But then people hate on it for not mindlessly sticking to a 1:1 replica of the cartoon.Honestly this show looks awesome, the sets, the colours, it's absolutely magnificent. The action scenes are epic in terms of fight choreography and the cgi for the bending is highly impressive.Regarding the script. Sure there's occasional weak lines- eg Katara telling Jet ""You are the bad guy"" and too many mentions of ""we need to save the world"". But overall the dialogue is pretty good. There's even some beautifully written dialogue in scenes which didn't exist in the original. Or perhaps there's a slightly different interpretation of a certain characters mindset and i was often impressed with the writing.People say the humour and charm are gone but they're wrong. They writers have created a fairly serious/dramatic live-action, but there's still a colourful vibe and some funny/wholesome moments dispersed throughout episodes. People complaining that Aang is too mature......eh it's kinda a weak criticism tbh. He is mature but he often has this childlike glowing look of excitement. I like how much energy his actor brings to the role even if occasionally it feels a bit forced.I'm often fairly critical of most modern shows tbh, but i actually had pretty high expectations because this is a valuable and beloved series. Episode 1 was a little wobbly for me in terms of storytelling and acting, but once i got into episodes 2 and 3 my high expectations were met and sustained till the end.I'm happy that we have this series which takes some creative liberty, while also being faithful to the spirit and message of the original cartoon.If the writers are reading this, go ahead and be as creative as you want about how to tell the story in season 2. Seriously go for it, because I'm a big fan of the cartoon... and the DIFFERENCES are what is making this most interesting for me.The people obsessed with having a 1:1 replica are a heavy minority of the viewership. If you feel like you can improve the plot in any way, go for it! Be brave!!","9","22 February 2024"
"Raewulf","I did some digging and went through a list of the staff and credits. A writer for this series released a video on how she entered the screenwriting business. Apparently, she got in there by luck, had been a rom-com and fan fiction enthusiast, and was fixated on female-centric themes, whatever that could mean. In her Q&A she mentions how they pitch ideas in the writing room and try to be yes-men for each other. I can't imagine what else I'll find on the others to see how their hobbies and politics can shape the show.The live adaptation, despite similar runtimes, deviates from the creative direction the original series laid out. They cram in cheap scenes between Monk Gyatso and Aang; chop and mix up the reunion sequence with King Bumi and the Gaang; expunge developed habits like Katara's motherly nagging and Sokka's negative thinking; rewrite Azula the controlling psychopathic princess as a victim; politicize an ancient Earth Kingdom legend; reveal Ozai's Angels and Fire Lord Ozai himself a bit early; cut out playful scenes like koi and penguin riding; delete subtleties like Katara's necklace affecting Pakku's arc; swap Aang for Sokka in the Cave of Two Lovers to drop the romance; disclose the significance of the comet, etc.There is also too much exposition when they could be dramatizing an emotional scene. Which has more impact? He's constantly pulled on the opposite ends of destiny and freedom. Aang plays with his airball buddies, impressing them with tricks, then he's told, at the age of 12, he's the Avatar, and his friends begin to alienate him for it. The talks of a looming conflict, demands of high level training, losing his sense of belonging, and increasing obligations upset him, despite Gyatso's futile pampering, and Aang, scared and confused, flees into a storm. Or Aang talks to himself. This is just one example out of many.By choosing the least creative path, you rob the viewer the chance to think and know, to love and hate, to weep and laugh. A story is always stronger by showing the physical actions and details of your characters. There is no shame in following the superior version; in fact, the adaptation relies on the strength of the original to cut seemingly negligible interactions meant to develop their characters. The animated series had true undeniable chemistry. We don't witness rapport to that extent in the live-action series.Aaron Ehasz, the head writer, did an excellent job in tidying up Bryan and Michael's original series. By now it should be clear you need people to shut down bad ideas too and Ehasz was that guy. Anyway, there is a lot to nitpick, like the casting choices, ticks like trembling or licking lips and vocal fry, cosplay tier costumes, etc. But I'd leave that to less busier minds.","3","23 February 2024"
"ahmed-emre","I don't even know why people are compare this with the film. The original comes from a cartoon. After seeing this I say just watch the original. They erased all the emotion and humor when making this series. Besides, people don't talk logically and most things are cringe. The fire lord explains his entire plan and the character understands it after an hour. Not only did they remove the Aang's breakdown from a scene, but they also made him look like someone who is afraid of taking responsibility and just wants to play games. What was important to him here was not playing games, but his friends. I still don't understand how you completely deleted these emotional things. I don't understand why they changed a perfect script. If you want something more mature and something that have humor, different emotions, watch the original. Netflix should give us new things instead of ruining good things.","3","22 February 2024"
"poseidon-thoughts","Hey, I get it. You're a true fan of the series, but as a fan you also need to realize that any series made into a live adaptation will never be as good as you dreamed it would be. The amount of character development can't be equal to a book or a cartoon series where the first chapter of 20 episodes is compressed into only 8 episodes. It's not realistic to expect that.What I can say, is this comes close to being the best live adaptation of a series I have ever seen and what I believe we will ever get. When do you think, this is ever going to happen again? Would you rather be willing to wait another 18 years before seeing something like this or would you sit back and enjoy it in this moment?There are some parts of the CGI that does look a bit weird for me, but the fight scenes and the bending are amazing! I expected only a small amount of bending but boy was I wrong. I feel the story is told well enough for the time it is given. Being unfamiliar with the story will give any new avatar watchers the entire explanation they need and make them want to go read the book or watch the cartoon series. The characters play the perfect part, and you see the resemblance in some of them. So much so that I almost fell over in my chair a couple of times seeing them for the first time.My advice for you is just enjoy it. If you don't like it then go watch the cartoon series, but I know you would rather be watching this!","9","23 February 2024"
"jacksonshawofficial","It is unfortunate to have a highly anticipated reboot falter, especially a second attempt at a reboot. I'm fan of the nickelodeon series and understood that a live action reboot may have issues story wise. Converting 20 stories into a single season that's palatable and long enough for the average viewer is necessary. But it's one thing to claim that you've MADE ""Avatar the Last Airbender"" when it's been stripped of its core.The biggest issue this series had was character development. Which is a laughable issue to have when you have a clear and concise blueprint already made. They've replaced the foil of each character from the original series with shallow issues that are resolved with a few minutes of poorly written dialogue.Examples of character development necessary to this story, that was removed or changed, include:Sokka's arrogance in his interactions with every character in the show.Katara's struggle with putting her bending over people's safety (the waterbending scroll).Aang's bending (Fire and Water) that inspires very good development with Katara and a developed fear of fire bending.Aang's ignorance and carefree demeanor that was reduced to a single line ( I'm silly and carefree) rather than showing his wanting to be a child and neglect his duties as the Avatar.King Bumi's identity and motivations revealed before trials and conflict.The premature introduction of Azula and her struggle with gaining respect from Ozai (she never needed that approval, she had the power and confidence when introduced in the second season and was shown to have fault in the third season.) Azula's character arc is the most interesting off all and it's been shattered now by an added layer of exposition that exposed her faults as a character and didn't focus on her power as a villain.Ozai's repeated appearance is a new feature. What makes the big bad a big bad is keeping it out of sight. If the characters are trying to stay away from the fire nation, don't show it and instigate fear within the story.The absence of Aang's crush on Katara (I figured they would at least allude to it) instead they give up one of the best scenes in the second seasons (SECRET TUNNEL) and shove it into a episode with 4 rotating storylines.Zuko's impulsivity and action based decision making, now reduced to whining.Zhao's obsession with fame and glory and inability to control his anger, reduced to a poorly written echo.Gyatzo's mentorship lacking a necessary feat for Aang's development; spontaneity and fun.Suki's confidence and stride now reduced to having a crush on Sokka.The rules of the spirit world and spirits were melded with; with Kho is was the lack of why he steals faces in the first place (he feeds off emotions), Katara and Sokka having the ability to travel into the spirit world.Taking away the Master aspect of the show, are we to believe Katara naturally gets better without a Master? And wasn't Aang supposed to learn from Pakku instead of being judged for not having learned waterbendeing?Hiding behind the excuse that the live action show needed to be different is weak. They promised ATLA and took away what made the show lovable, its characters. This was a messy rendition. The writers failed to create something new with old material, they reduced it. It's commercialized and lazy. You would think with a 20 million dollar budget on each episode, that they would have the means to make it worthwhile.These are a lot of examples, but it's everything I've noticed watching. The've expanded on a couple of themes and moments within the show that made it more interesting. Adding the consequence of Aang merging with the Ocean spirit was cool, and perhaps the most interesting part. I think they should focus on that kind of expansion on themes from the original source material a bit more. I would watch another season, but they need to do better. They need to stick with the original source material. And they would have to let Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko take the reins on writing.","5","2 March 2024"
"jacobtarter","Since I can't give halves , I was gunna give it an 8.6/10 but I rounded up to 9.Acting was pretty good , some wooden scenes especially with Aang and Katara. But they're expected since their newer actors Gordon literally has like only one scene before this show lol. But he does portray his innocence well and his acting is good for someone in his technically first role. Dallas (Zuko ) and Ian (Sokka ) were the real standoutsThe production, in terms of cgi , sets and bending was overall really good. When Aang goes into the avatar state it generally does look kinda scary in a way. The fight scenes were prob my fav part , they do a great job at handling them , and I really that they did a fight scene that didn't really feature much bending between 2 powerful bendersThere is actually a lot of changes , some I might not like but i 100% get or just others I might have to fully understand on a rewatchBut even tho it's def more serious then the original there's still some of that innocence of the original'sI'll say this tho , just give it a shot and come in with an open mind . If u come in expecting a straight 1 of 1, or for it to be as good as the original , then ur not gunna like it. I've seen some reviews where it's just getting compared to the original, which wouldn't really be that fair since the original is perfection to many ppl and others where u can tell ppl are just upset that it's not a 1 of 1. And remember it's an adaptation, not a remake.","9","22 February 2024"
"just_funme","I got to admit, I did get excited after watching the trailers, so whoever put them together, absolutely great job. Everyone else disappointed me and all fans of the original show.Both Shyamalan and the writers for this newest adaptation have failed to realize what made ATLA special, i.e. The writing and atmosphere.Writing as in story, character development arcs, the little bits and bobs that brought them togheter, the pacing, the dialogue, the contrast between Aang's innocence and his actual duty, so many other things that will make this review a small book... The jist of it is, the writers spun the story and events to appeal to modern audiences and I feel that either they're extremely smart and think the entire population of the earth is intellectually challenged or they are part of the 2nd category themselves.Writers today heavily underestimate the viewers and their capabilities of following a story or they can't do it themselves and use exposition dumps just to make sure they never have to write something more complex, of which I remind you, they already had the material. They could've copy + paste the entire story and they would've been acclaimed as geniuses, but unfortunately, they did not... Extremely lazy writing and interpretation.In the atmosphere department, I will fully admit they did justice to the visuals, everything looks stunning and perfectly translated from the animation. What they screw up though is, again, the child-like freedom of the story. And the worst offensive is the generic from the shelf background music, used in almost every single scene, because apparently they didn't trust the kid actors to do their job ( and they were right unfortunately ) and needed further emphasis on what the viewers are supposed to feel at any given moment.Again, I can go into further detail, but this is already longer than it should've been. I wanted to keep it short, say how amazing it was and urge everyone to give it a go, but life is often disappointing.I'm only going to lightly spoil the first episode, but keep in mind that there are reccuring issues.They changed events that are iconic to the series. The ""come closer... Wanna come penguin sledding with me ??"" is gone. Gran gran became the exposition dump bender, far worse than in the series. Katara suddenly learns to waterbend way beyond what she w9as able to in basically 1 short scene. Furthermore, instead of the deck fight with Zuko where she freezes the soldiers ( the fight is again, iconic ) she is the one that stops Zuko's fireball aimed at them. Because she's not enough of a badass by the end of the series, she needs to be a girl boss right from the get go.Why show of how powerful Aang is, which is something she constantly acknowledges over the series until she also gains incredible power by struggling enduring and constantly improving, when she can learn starting in the first 30 mins of the show ? Why let the male actor have the initial glory ?Not to mention her motherly personality is a thing of the past...Look... You can watch it, it's.... decent. For some people distracted by pretty lights it can also be a 10/10 since I fully admited it does look stunning.But, if you are a fan of the original or you don't like being talked down to, you'll not enjoy it. You are STILL better off watching the ""kids"" show, and that's just sad in my opinion. They had ample time to not screw it up and the absolute perfect material, and yet, unfortunately, they did...I tried, I really did. Too many things were changed and not in a good way. I truly believe the entertainment industry thinks of us as chickens, with similar attention spans. And I am so tired of it.Good luck to the newer generations...","3","22 February 2024"
"jeffreykare","As a longtime fan of the original series, I couldn't be happier with how this show turned out. The first episode alone kept me smiling from start to finish. It not only stays true to the original animated series, but also offers some surprises for both longtime fans and newcomers alike. The performances are really good. The tone is just right. The visuals are stunning. The action sequences are emotionally engaging. The cliffhanger definitely leaves you wanting more. Here's hoping this proves to be successful enough to give us a second season. Please don't let the mixed nor negative reviews persuade you from not giving this a chance. Please give this a watch.","8","23 February 2024"
"arvinjanasis","Here's my initial review after watching all 8 episodes
Cons
-Where's the humor?-Where's Sokka saying ""Food!"" when they see Momo for the first time?-No character development from any of them
-Where's the fainting fanboy from Kyoshi Island?-Where's ""My name is (sneezes) aang!!!"" Or Sokka hitting Aang in the head as they meet him first time
-No relationship between characters
-Why show Azula, Mai, Ty Lee right away?-Ozai's face is shown right away
-What happened to Iroh's character?-Bumi's character is also very different
-No waterbending training? For real?-Aang is always MIA
-Katara's necklace storyline
-June
-Appa has literally less than 5 mins screen time
-No intro like the series
-Showing too much of what should be shown in Season 2 or 3
-How they squeezed episodes from episodes
-Where's the unagi?-Why did Suki removed her makeup?-Why did Zuko fight Ozai in Agni Kai? He literally did nothing in the series and just took his father's attack
-Too much telling, less showing
-Butchered the tale of two lovers
-Avatar state
-and morePros
-Attack at Southern Air Temple
-Fight scenes
-Bending scenes
-Good visuals
-Definitely better than the movie
-The BG theme was usedSo far this is my initial take. Episode 1 showed that there's a chance that this will be an amazing season. But coming from someone who loved the cartoon series, I felt disappointed. Maybe I have expected too much.Could've been really better and they really should've focused on Book 1 alone. But hey the cinematic experience was still amazing! The cartoon/anime series will always be better. Sorry but really and should really have been better.","9","22 February 2024"
